A positive covariance suggests that the variables move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that they move in opposite directions. However, it doesn't provide a standardized measure, making it difficult to compare relationships between different pairs of variables.\n",

Correlation is more useful than covariance as it allows for comparisons between different pairs of variables, regardless of the units of measurement.\n",
